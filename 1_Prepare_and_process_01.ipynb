    "The purpose of this notebook is to prepare and process the CSV file from Kaggle's dataset created by CRXXOM (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crxxom/daily-google-news/data) to make it ready for my project. For my first project, I won't be using Python for EDA; instead, I'll be using SQL. I aim to enhance my understanding of SQL, specifically MySQL, before delving deeper into Python's libraries. I'm simply using this notebook with the Pandas library imported for the prepare and process phases because it is faster than using spreadsheets. Additionally, it is easier to document the process when I can share it publicly."
